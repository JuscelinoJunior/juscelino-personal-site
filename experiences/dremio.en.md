I worked as an outsourced contractor for international projects. Development of an open source project called
Arrow Flight SQL that aimed to create a single point of access for SQL databases. In addition, I worked as QA on
Dremio Arctic, which was a project to enable a Git-like experience for Data Lakes or other data sources.
